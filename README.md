# Global-Prosperity-Ranking---Visualisation
## Overview
This project analyzes and classifies countries based on their "Average Score" and investigates the relationship between "Average Score" and "Safety and Security."

In the first visualization, countries are classified into categories based on their average score, providing a general view of how many countries fall in each class.
The second visualization showcases the correlation between a country's average score and its safety and security levels. This allows us to observe how safety and security vary in relation to prosperity and well-being, providing deeper insights into the relationship between these two factors.

The classes I defined are as follows: 
Below Average (C)
Average (B)
Prosperous (A)
The classification is based on quartiles (Q1, Q3) and interquartile range (IQR) of the Average Scores. 

## 1-Bar Plot showing the distribution of countries according to different classes.
This bar plot provides a visual representation of how countries are distributed across three distinct classes based on their "Average Score." The classes—Below Average (C), Average (B), and Prosperous (A)—are derived using quartiles to classify the countries based on their overall performance. By showing the number of countries in each class, this plot offers a quick and clear way to understand the global distribution of prosperity and well-being.

## 2-Scatter Plot to display the relationship between Average Score and Safety & Security, with an interactive hover feature
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between a country's "Average Score" and its "Safety and Security" rating. Each point represents a country, color-coded according to its class (Below Average, Average, or Prosperous). By exploring this plot, one can observe how safety and security align with overall prosperity, providing a deeper understanding of how these two important factors interact. The interactive hover feature allows you to explore country-specific details for more granular insights.
